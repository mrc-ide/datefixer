Description: datefixer is an R package for Bayesian estimation of event dates
 and delay distributions using epidemiological line-list data. It is designed
 to handle commonly encountered issues with line-list datasets during outbreaks,
 including missing event dates (e.g., symptom onset, hospitalisation, or death)
 and errors in recorded dates.
